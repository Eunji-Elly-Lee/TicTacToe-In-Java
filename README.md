### Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid to get three of their marks in a row.

- Players alternately place their marks, either X or O, in one of the nine blocks in the grid.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins the game.
- If all nine blocks are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.

This Tic-Tac-Toe game is implemented in JavaFX and can be run in Eclipse or VS Code.
