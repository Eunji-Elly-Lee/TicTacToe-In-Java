This program is that lets two users play the tic-tac-toe game using GUI.

- Users alternately place their marks, which are X and O, in one of the nine blocks in the grid.
- They can mark their owns' by clicking on a block on their turn.
- Even if users click on the blocks that has already been marked, it doesn't affect the game.
- A user placing three of their marks on a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line first will be the winner.
- If all nine blocks are marked without a winner, the game will end in a draw.
